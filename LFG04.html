1
00:01:02,783 --> 00:01:04,312
Why am I doing this?

2
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:06,743
Am I even doing it right?

3
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,213
Bong Pal.

4
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:46,512
How do I look?

5
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:49,712
- What?
- Do I look okay?

6
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,382
Well, your dress does.

7
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:54,413
Gosh.

8
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:02,983
This is pretty.

9
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,542
- Let's go.
- To where?

10
00:02:11,543 --> 00:02:13,543
To work.

11
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,782
You owe me that dress.

12
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:18,842
What?

13
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:21,843
Wait. What will we do at this late hour?

14
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,782
How can I fight in this new dress?

15
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:27,543
(Emperor's Sauna)

16
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:14,283
(Bring it on, Ghost)

17
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:17,113
(Episode 4)

18
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,082
Yes, Sir.

19
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,542
I'll text you my account number.

20
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,883
Okay. Take care.

21
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:27,542
Right.

22
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:30,183
I should tell Cheon Sang and In Rang as well.

23
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,312
What is this? What's going on?

24
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:40,313
Yes.

25
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:42,543
Now?

26
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:45,343
Sure, I'm available.

27
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,542
Let's go. We have another job to do.

28
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:50,182
Again?

29
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,782
I'm too tired.

30
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:53,782
They need us right now.

31
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,112
Aren't you being too harsh on me?

32
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:57,382
I'm too exhausted even to get through that door.

33
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:59,382
I just knocked my head on it.

34
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:01,312
Let's take a day off.

35
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:03,412
No way. You agreed to help.

36
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:06,112
In return, I'd provide you with food, shelter and help you study.

37
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,782
- Did you forget?
- Still, this is too much.

38
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:12,182
For one dress, you're making me work all day long.

39
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,912
And when will we start studying?

40
00:04:14,913 --> 00:04:17,212
All right. We'll study after this job. Okay?

41
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,342
No. I'm not going.

42
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,613
Where are you going? Let's go.

43
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:25,183
- I'm so tired.
- Hurry.

44
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,812
Look at this mess.

45
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:35,682
It'll take us forever to clean this up.

46
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:37,942
The committee will go crazy if they find this out.

47
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:41,842
You should be grateful that you're still alive.

48
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:44,442
Of course. I will be grateful for the rest of my life...

49
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:46,483
It's time to pray.

50
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:52,643
Let me express my gratitude to all divinities.

51
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,742
This isn't right.

52
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:57,742
I must thank Bong Pal the most.

53
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,952
He's mean to us,

54
00:04:59,953 --> 00:05:02,452
but he ran over to save me when I was in need.

55
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:04,843
That's a real man.

56
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:07,542
How did he know that I was in danger?

57
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,913
Well, that is...

58
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,643
Hold on a second.

59
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:14,482
It's Bong Pal.

60
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,182
Did he send you a message?

61
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,952
Is it to check if I'm all right?

62
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,212
He must be warm-hearted.

63
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:24,913
- No, that's not why he texted me.
- What is it? Show me.

64
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:30,953
Wire me the money.

65
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,843
What is he talking about?

66
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,912
He said he charges 1,000 dollars per ghost.

67
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,953
1,000...

68
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:43,983
- 1,000 dollars?
- Yes.

69
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:47,742
Wait. Let me think...

70
00:05:47,743 --> 00:05:49,813
So...

71
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:53,742
So he didn't come to save me.

72
00:05:53,743 --> 00:05:55,712
- That's right.
- He is so...

73
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:58,212
- He's money driven.
- Do you have 1,000 dollars?

74
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,882
I don't.

75
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:01,642
What should we do now?

76
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:05,113
He'll never let us walk away with it.

77
00:06:06,943 --> 00:06:08,012
I don't know. I don't...

78
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,282
Just ignore him. I don't know.

79
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:12,212
Ignore him?

80
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,212
But...

81
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:14,642
Is President Choi Cheon Sang in?

82
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:16,282
I'm from the club committee.

83
00:06:16,283 --> 00:06:17,942
I know you're in there.

84
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:21,313
You know you can't just ignore my phone calls.

85
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,042
President Choi.

86
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:25,083
President Choi.

87
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:26,782
President Choi.

88
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:29,213
President Choi!

89
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:34,843
Gosh.

90
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:52,112
How long did I sleep?

91
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:54,843
I was utterly worn out.

92
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,842
Bong Pal.

93
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:59,913
Bong Pal.

94
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:07,583
Bong Pal.

95
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:13,213
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,582
Trust me. I didn't see anything.

97
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,082
Present yourself properly.

98
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,382
You know I can't do that.

99
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:24,342
You can't just burst into my room without knocking.

100
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,343
Okay.

101
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:28,112
By the way,

102
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:30,913
you look a little different today.

103
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:34,583
You're neatly dressed.

104
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:37,213
Did you also groom your hair?

105
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:38,312
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:41,312
Right. You have a class with her today.

107
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:44,512
- Right?
- What do you mean?

108
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:46,713
I'm leaving. Don't follow me.

109
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,242
Why not? Is it because you want to be with her alone?

110
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,112
You're wrong. Didn't you say you're tired?

111
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:53,982
Take a good rest.

112
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:56,042
And don't intrude into my room...

113
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:58,082
or touch my stuff.

114
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,113
Bye.

115
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,783
What am I allowed to do, then?

116
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,413
Have a good day.

117
00:08:10,783 --> 00:08:12,782
Bong Pal, let's go together.

118
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,242
What? You said bye.

119
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,112
Did I? No, I didn't say that.

120
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:18,482
Aren't you tired of following me?

121
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,542
It's too boring to stay home alone.

122
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:24,882
Plus, I can't just stay home in such nice dress.

123
00:08:24,883 --> 00:08:27,683
Sure. Whatever.

124
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:35,643
(Notice: This room is temporarily closed.)

125
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,712
We'll charge you the repair cost soon.

126
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,142
Okay?

127
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,143
Okay.

128
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:50,983
Okay...

129
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:58,012
Cheon Sang. Stop.

130
00:08:58,013 --> 00:09:01,943
No, stop. Calm down.

131
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:06,712
So what will we do now?

132
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,143
I have no idea.

133
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:14,312
What? What was it?

134
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:16,642
What was it? What did you see?

135
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:20,313
(Myeongseong University)

136
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:23,982
Why are you so happy?

137
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,182
There's no reason.

138
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:29,583
Don't I look like a college student in this dress?

139
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,083
Not really.

140
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,052
That's Kyung Ja.

141
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,382
Who?

142
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:41,282
Bong Pal, I need to see someone.

143
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,313
Who?

144
00:09:44,913 --> 00:09:46,242
Goodness.

145
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,052
Kyung Ja.

146
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,742
- Hello, Hyun Ji.
- Why are you here?

147
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:52,412
My honey I talked about earlier is in this college.

148
00:09:52,413 --> 00:09:54,413
I see.

149
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,983
Look at your dress.

150
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:00,442
- How do I look today?
- How?

151
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,312
You look beautiful.

152
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:05,212
You looked pretty in school uniform,

153
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:07,742
but even prettier in this dress.

154
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,242
I'm sure you're one of the most beautiful ghosts.

155
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,443
No way.

156
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:17,143
It would have been perfect if you had high heels.

157
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,783
Who burned this for you?

158
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,553
Is it Sundae?

159
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:26,712
It is.

160
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:29,982
What's going on? He kissed you before...

161
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:32,483
and burned you a dress.

162
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:35,552
I think he likes you.

163
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:36,552
That's nonsense.

164
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,712
Why is it nonsense?

165
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:41,682
I'm a ghost and like humans. Humans can like ghosts too!

166
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,882
It's not like that.

167
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:47,242
I had to nag him all day long to get this out of him.

168
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:51,113
And he has a crush on someone else.

169
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:56,212
You know nothing about guys.

170
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:59,983
Trust me. He likes you.

171
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:03,243
No way.

172
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:09,112
Hey. Who did you meet?

173
00:11:09,113 --> 00:11:11,613
Just a ghost I know.

174
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:16,383
Trust me. He likes you.

175
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,552
What is it? Why are you smiling?

176
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,553
It's nothing.

177
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,913
Bong Pal.

178
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,212
Good morning.

179
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:26,812
- You're early today.
- Yes.

180
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:28,382
Let's go and prepare for the class.

181
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,882
Sure.

182
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:32,013
I knew it.

183
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,613
They're so pretty.

184
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:50,213
Let me carry them.

185
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,442
You don't have to.

186
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:54,583
It's okay. I'll do it.

187
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,343
Look at you, Mr Superman.

188
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,712
Anyone could see that you like her.

189
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:14,713
But you can't even talk to her.

190
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:23,283
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

191
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,012
Don't be shy.

192
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,812
You guys are early today.

193
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:30,582
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

194
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,183
Thank you for helping me from this early in the morning.

195
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:36,943
- Are they today's class materials?
- Yes.

196
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,582
Did you get hurt?

197
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,142
You have a scar on your hand.

198
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,543
It's nothing serious.

199
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,413
- That looks bad.
- Oh no.

200
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:53,613
I forgot some class materials.

201
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:03,212
They even ate their skin.

202
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:06,282
They used to be only considered as means of production,

203
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,842
- but today...
- Bong Pal.

204
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,482
They're considered as humans' companions.

205
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:13,943
The professor seemed to avoid me.

206
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:17,012
They can even help people fight depression.

207
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,412
What are you talking about?

208
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:21,612
They sometimes show a lot of affection...

209
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:22,742
Am I mistaken?

210
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:26,643
Animal testing is...

211
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,782
Why aren't these guys answering me?

212
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,512
Who do you mean?

213
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,412
Oh, you mean that comic duo.

214
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:42,183
They seemed broke. I don't think you'll ever get paid.

215
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:46,282
The number is not reachable.

216
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,643
Gosh. Those rats.

217
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:58,342
What is this?

218
00:13:58,343 --> 00:14:01,313
What do you think it is? They disappeared.

219
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,482
Don't you realise what's happening?

220
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,512
If they don't pay me, no money will be deducted for you.

221
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,042
What?

222
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,582
How dare they do this to us?

223
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,613
Hey. Call them right now.

224
00:14:14,013 --> 00:14:16,043
Gosh.

225
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:21,612
Please pay 892 dollars at General Affairs by 23rd...

226
00:14:21,613 --> 00:14:23,743
for facility repairs.

227
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:26,742
- What does it say?
- We need to pay 892 dollars...

228
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:28,943
for the club room repair.

229
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:34,682
(Park Bong Pal)

230
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:36,282
- Who is it?
- We need to pay Bong Pal...

231
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:38,843
1,000 dollars for the exorcism.

232
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:42,713
- This is impossible.
- Gosh, stop.

233
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:47,912
1,892 dollars?

234
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,542
How are we going to make that money?

235
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:54,413
I'm still paying for the camera in instalments.

236
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,042
I couldn't ask my parents for help.

237
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:58,582
You really have no money?

238
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,112
I really have no money.

239
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:02,182
Who do you think you're asking? I'm broke.

240
00:15:02,183 --> 00:15:05,682
Then ask someone for help. You can't be sitting back like this.

241
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:08,983
Fine. I get it.

242
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,213
I'm older than you.

243
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:27,113
- Hello.
- In Rang. I'm broke.

244
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,813
Can you lend me some money?

245
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,112
- Did you really call me?
- Yes, I did.

246
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:35,643
You're my only friend.

247
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,113
Hyun Joo.

248
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:47,482
Hi, Seo Yeon.

249
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:50,542
You didn't come to the class today.

250
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:52,783
Something came up.

251
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:54,882
What's the matter?

252
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:57,512
We have an assignment.

253
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,513
Give me a second.

254
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:06,043
- Hello.
- Hello.

255
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,483
Kitty.

256
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,513
Where are you, Kitty?

257
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:54,913
Hyun Joo.

258
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:02,383
This belongs to Professor Ju.

259
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,712
What are you doing? Are you going to have lunch?

260
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:09,713
Is food all you can think of?

261
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:14,142
What is this?

262
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,312
You wanted me to tutor you.

263
00:18:16,313 --> 00:18:20,012
I need to test you before making you a study plan.

264
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,482
I'll give you an hour to finish the test.

265
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:26,613
Right now? I have a little headache today.

266
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:29,612
Don't you want to ascend?

267
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:32,012
You said you need to take the exam to ascend.

268
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:34,312
I'm not ready yet.

269
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,582
You have an hour.

270
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,042
All right. Start.

271
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:40,443
Wait.

272
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:51,142
Four?

273
00:18:51,143 --> 00:18:53,143
Or is it two?

274
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:03,142
If you don't know it, skip it.

275
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,343
I'm not going to give up.

276
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:24,283
How many points will make you ascend?

277
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:30,543
I guess I need a score that would get me into this university.

278
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:34,343
I'm afraid you won't be able to ascend...

279
00:19:34,513 --> 00:19:36,612
this year.

280
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:38,613
Why?

281
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,382
(Mock Exam)

282
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:41,542
32 points out of 100?

283
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:43,783
32 points out of 100.

284
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,482
It'll take at least three years...

285
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,042
for you to barely make it.

286
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:51,512
Are you sure you're going to take the exam?

287
00:19:51,513 --> 00:19:53,712
It's been five years since I last tried it.

288
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:55,442
Regardless of that,

289
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:57,482
this exam is the easiest one.

290
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,782
Even a middle schooler would do better than you.

291
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:02,643
So what? Are you bragging that you were a good student?

292
00:20:03,413 --> 00:20:05,513
I quit.

293
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,412
You're the one who did a poor job. What are you upset for?

294
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:10,142
You don't understand.

295
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:14,843
I didn't sleep well last night, so I wasn't feeling very well.

296
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:18,843
- Then take another test.
- What?

297
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,782
What are you talking about?

298
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:22,983
I'm busy.

299
00:20:27,513 --> 00:20:29,513
Professor.

300
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:32,512
Hi, Seo Yeon.

301
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:34,482
What are you doing here?

302
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,882
I have something to give you.

303
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:40,713
Here. It's yours, isn't it?

304
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,613
Oh, it is.

305
00:20:44,683 --> 00:20:48,582
Thanks. How do you have it?

306
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:52,382
My classmate must have picked it up somewhere.

307
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:54,642
- Who is it?
- Her name is Noh Hyun Joo.

308
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:56,342
Yes, I remember her.

309
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:58,042
She missed her class today, right?

310
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,082
- You're right.
- I see.

311
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,812
Anyway, thank you again. I was looking for this.

312
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:05,982
You're welcome. I'll be on my way, then.

313
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:08,013
All right.

314
00:21:08,013 --> 00:21:10,252
Oh right. How is the dog doing?

315
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:11,382
Fine. Thank you.

316
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,612
Feel free to ask if you need any help.

317
00:21:13,613 --> 00:21:15,042
I will. Thank you.

318
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:17,083
You're welcome. See you.

319
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:56,042
That really hurts, you quack.

320
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:58,082
Nobody would come...

321
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,382
if you're so bad like this.

322
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:01,512
I'm a lot better than you are.

323
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,513
Give me your hand.

324
00:22:03,883 --> 00:22:06,443
That really hurts.

325
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:12,182
Your energy is all twisted.

326
00:22:12,183 --> 00:22:14,543
It's not getting better at all.

327
00:22:14,843 --> 00:22:16,082
It's hopeless.

328
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,443
You're hopeless.

329
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,883
Gosh. Please.

330
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:25,312
You were lucky to survive all those things.

331
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:28,912
Does Bong Pal know you got ruined like this to save him?

332
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,142
Why would I tell him?

333
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:33,542
Don't tell him anything about it.

334
00:22:33,543 --> 00:22:35,512
And I'm not ruined. I'm healthy, can't you see?

335
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:40,112
It may look okay outside but it's all ruined inside.

336
00:22:40,113 --> 00:22:43,012
Don't forget to do diaphragmatic breathing every day.

337
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:45,543
Gosh, it hurts.

338
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:49,142
Have you been to the place where Bong Pal's father lives?

339
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:51,142
People there told me that he left some time ago.

340
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:54,883
He never tells me where he is going.

341
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:57,182
Is he...

342
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:59,642
chasing after that thing?

343
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:02,513
That evil ghost which killed his wife.

344
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,883
I think so.

345
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,612
It's been more than 10 years.

346
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:09,612
I couldn't find anything noticeable in his room except those.

347
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:12,283
I found them on the floor.

348
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:14,582
I don't know what rushed him,

349
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,382
but it seems he was in a hurry.

350
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:19,512
He couldn't even finish the letter to his son.

351
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:21,882
By the way,

352
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:27,012
I heard that someone else was looking for him too.

353
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:28,582
Who?

354
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:32,642
The landlady said she didn't see his face properly.

355
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:37,412
She said that he was a young, good looking man.

356
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,183
- A young, good looking man?
- Yes.

357
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:42,812
Gosh.

358
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:47,843
(Digital Camera Store)

359
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,512
Sorry, you can't sell it here.

360
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,082
What?

361
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,082
Why not?

362
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,512
I bought this two months ago.

363
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:59,942
It's under warranty for two years.

364
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,342
It seems that...

365
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:03,642
you tried to put something into it by force.

366
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,512
It's no longer under warranty if you mishandled it.

367
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:09,512
It would be cheaper to buy a new one instead.

368
00:24:09,513 --> 00:24:14,343
We never tried to put anything in...

369
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,912
It was you.

370
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:33,512
You tried to fix this.

371
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,813
I told you not to try anything because it would void the warranty.

372
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,712
I didn't do it.

373
00:24:39,713 --> 00:24:41,082
This...

374
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:43,812
You know what this cost me.

375
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:45,512
I do. You bought it with your dormitory fee.

376
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:47,242
Yes. I still need to pay the instalment for another 10 months.

377
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:49,512
- I also lied to my family.
- You did.

378
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:51,513
Then why?

379
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,982
Well, I didn't do that...

380
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:56,782
I didn't. It wasn't me. It was my hands.

381
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:59,343
My hands did it.

382
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:02,482
Why? What's wrong? No, don't.

383
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:05,583
Don't do it. No.

384
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:19,183
It scares me every time he does that.

385
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:21,342
In Rang.

386
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:24,082
In Rang. Go. Go away.

387
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,212
- I'll buy you a meal.
- Go.

388
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:28,413
Go away.

389
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,913
Don't be mad.

390
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:45,912
Shall we drink some soju?

391
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,812
Soju? Don't even think about it.

392
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,583
We're broke.

393
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:04,013
Take out all the money you have.

394
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,842
Did you think you could afford soju?

395
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,412
Did you?

396
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:22,712
This is barely enough for the meal.

397
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:24,943
You wanted to drink soju.

398
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,042
Where will you sleep tonight?

399
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:33,342
- How about you?
- I'll go home.

400
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,212
- What about me?
- Come with me then.

401
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:38,742
Your grandmother hates me.

402
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:40,813
She despises me.

403
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:48,612
Where are you going?

404
00:26:48,613 --> 00:26:51,243
I'm in a hurry to find somewhere to sleep.

405
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,183
Are you going to leave me?

406
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:59,113
Wait for me.

407
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:15,442
Do I have to study all these books?

408
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:16,942
Study all these books?

409
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:18,612
These are only the beginning.

410
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:20,913
There are a lot more coming after these.

411
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,783
Which will you study first?

412
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,012
Mathematics.

413
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,113
(Mathematics)

414
00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:32,582
No, this seems wrong.

415
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,982
Shall I study Korean first?

416
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,082
Let's study mathematics first.

417
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,542
Why did you ask then?

418
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:38,182
I can hear you.

419
00:27:38,183 --> 00:27:40,213
Sit properly.

420
00:27:41,083 --> 00:27:43,113
Here.

421
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:47,483
All right. Let's see.

422
00:27:50,883 --> 00:27:52,612
My stomach hurts.

423
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,713
I need to go to the toilet.

424
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:57,913
You're a ghost.

425
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,412
My head is splitting.

426
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,413
Give me a moment.

427
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:08,182
No more weaselling.

428
00:28:08,183 --> 00:28:10,442
You asked me to teach you.

429
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:13,213
- So focus.
- Okay.

430
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:17,182
Trigonometry. You can do this.

431
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:19,383
Here. Try.

432
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:25,682
If a real number A is the limit of X approaching A,

433
00:28:25,683 --> 00:28:27,182
then Gx equals to B...

434
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:30,343
and as Gx is continuous...

435
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,483
Are you sleeping?

436
00:28:36,843 --> 00:28:38,913
She didn't solve any.

437
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,812
Hyun Ji.

438
00:28:40,813 --> 00:28:42,843
Gosh.

439
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:22,142
Let's just go somewhere close.

440
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,182
How long must we go?

441
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:26,682
They are giving us 50 percent discount.

442
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,682
We must go there no matter what.

443
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,382
We're almost there.

444
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,443
Around here...

445
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:35,742
There. There it is.

446
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:37,182
That's the place.

447
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:39,243
Right over there.

448
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,282
Here you are.

449
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:45,813
Goodness. You have a lot of luggage.

450
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:48,612
I'll keep them for free.

451
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:50,212
Have a good rest.

452
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:52,812
- Take this.
- Thank you.

453
00:29:52,813 --> 00:29:54,082
- Thank you so much.
- Here they are.

454
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,143
All right. Hand them to me.

455
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,082
- That one too?
- Yes, please.

456
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,142
Okay, sure.

457
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:03,743
- Have a good rest.
- Thank you.

458
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:11,342
Everything is so nice and clean. The owner is kind, too.

459
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,383
Why is it so empty?

460
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:15,982
That's good for us.

461
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,442
It's all ours.

462
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:19,112
Let's enjoy some sauna then.

463
00:30:19,113 --> 00:30:21,012
That sounds great.

464
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:23,042
Nice. So nice.

465
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:25,383
We can go to women's sauna too.

466
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:31,142
It's so hot, I'm melting.

467
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,642
It's hot.

468
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:34,512
- It's so hot.
- Gosh.

469
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,182
Cheon Sang.

470
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:38,482
How long do we have to live like this?

471
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:40,312
Tomorrow...

472
00:30:40,313 --> 00:30:42,082
will worry about itself.

473
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,143
Let's think about it tomorrow.

474
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:45,612
Okay.

475
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,643
- Let's just sleep.
- Let's sleep.

476
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:53,543
Let's think about it tomorrow.

477
00:30:56,513 --> 00:30:59,113
I don't have anyone to text me.

478
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:02,742
Guys, you better not be like that.

479
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,742
- It's Bong Pal.
- It's Bong Pal.

480
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,012
What did he say?

481
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:09,012
- He wants money.
- He's so persistent.

482
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:10,942
He's so evil.

483
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:12,782
What should I say?

484
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,783
Give it to me.

485
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:20,113
- I don't care. Let's sleep.
- What?

486
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:22,512
Okay, then. I should sleep, too.

487
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,543
I don't care, either.

488
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:48,413
Gosh, it's hot.

489
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,583
Gosh. In Rang...

490
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:09,213
In Rang... In Rang...

491
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:24,012
In Rang!

492
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:26,912
- Help!
- What is it?

493
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:28,913
- What is it?
- Hey!

494
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,943
Open the door.

495
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,412
It's already open. What's the problem?

496
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:37,413
What is it?

497
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:45,183
Ouch, my neck.

498
00:32:46,983 --> 00:32:49,283
- Are you up?
- Yes.

499
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:51,282
Why am I sleeping here?

500
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:54,412
Why are you asking me? You're the one who fell asleep.

501
00:32:54,413 --> 00:32:56,683
Did I?

502
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,213
Why didn't you wake me up?

503
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:02,082
I tried. You didn't wake up.

504
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:04,182
Why didn't you put me on the couch then?

505
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,442
How can you let a girl sleep like this?

506
00:33:05,443 --> 00:33:07,042
You're too heavy.

507
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:09,743
I can't sacrifice my back for you.

508
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:12,043
You little...

509
00:33:14,683 --> 00:33:16,843
What a jerk.

510
00:33:19,913 --> 00:33:23,643
Look at that. It's open.

511
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:27,883
Bong Pal told me not to go in there...

512
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:36,713
Why is there so much stuff?

513
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:40,582
Hong Myung Hee?

514
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,583
Who is that?

515
00:34:06,483 --> 00:34:09,243
It's just my size.

516
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:15,512
Hey, what are you doing here?

517
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,242
Bong Pal, whose shoes are these?

518
00:34:17,243 --> 00:34:19,283
Can you burn them for me?

519
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,912
I told you not to come in here.

520
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:29,982
Who told you you could touch things in here?

521
00:34:29,983 --> 00:34:33,583
- Well, I just...
- You...

522
00:34:34,043 --> 00:34:36,043
are a ghost.

523
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:39,843
Don't act like you're a human.

524
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:50,413
Why is he so upset?

525
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:52,983
What did I do so wrong?

526
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:29,343
My goodness.

527
00:35:30,153 --> 00:35:32,983
Here. Are you all right?

528
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:39,943
I keep seeing ghosts lately. Am I cursed this year?

529
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:42,443
Cheon Sang.

530
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,512
Look at this.

531
00:35:44,513 --> 00:35:47,413
There was a reason why that place was cheap.

532
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,582
He died there a month ago. Just a month ago.

533
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:56,383
The whole neighbourhood knows that a ghost shows up there.

534
00:35:58,343 --> 00:35:59,912
Why did you take me there?

535
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:02,083
I didn't know either.

536
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:05,652
They performed exorcism that cost over 10 grand there.

537
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:08,682
They used that much money and the ghost is still there?

538
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:11,613
- They should give us the money.
- I know, right?

539
00:36:11,943 --> 00:36:15,112
Let's go to the empty lecture hall to take a nap.

540
00:36:15,113 --> 00:36:17,813
Are you that sleepy?

541
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:20,712
- Yes.
- The number you're calling...

542
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:22,442
is currently turned off. You will be connected to...

543
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:24,442
Is his phone still off?

544
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,543
These guys...

545
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,942
- What is it?
- Bong Pal.

546
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,983
Hey.

547
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:40,843
In Rang!

548
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:45,883
Hey!

549
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:57,612
We're not trying to rip you off.

550
00:36:57,613 --> 00:37:01,343
- We just need more time.
- How much time?

551
00:37:01,983 --> 00:37:03,342
- Two months.
- What?

552
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:04,342
Two days.

553
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,543
- Yes, 2 days.
- Just 2 days.

554
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:09,882
How can we get that much money in that time?

555
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,512
Be quiet.

556
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:14,283
We can pay you back in two days.

557
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,152
How?

558
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,183
It's a secret.

559
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:21,783
How?

560
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:24,343
It's a secret.

561
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,783
She probably didn't even eat.

562
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:07,413
I'm so hungry.

563
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:11,813
I bet Bong Pal is eating right now.

564
00:38:13,213 --> 00:38:14,942
Should I go to his school?

565
00:38:14,943 --> 00:38:18,743
You are a ghost.

566
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:21,713
Don't act like you're a human.

567
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:27,613
I know that I'm a ghost, too.

568
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:36,183
(Emperor's Sauna)

569
00:38:48,183 --> 00:38:51,443
Do we have to dress like this?

570
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,213
If we have to do it, we should do it right.

571
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,613
Let's go.

572
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,212
(Temporarily closed)

573
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,883
Are you having trouble because of ghosts?

574
00:39:09,343 --> 00:39:12,543
Exorcism didn't work, did it?

575
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:14,743
We'll...

576
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:19,183
solve that problem for you.

577
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:33,843
It's Bong Pal.

578
00:39:53,883 --> 00:39:56,913
Why do you have the lights off? It's so dark.

579
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:58,942
What's wrong with the dark?

580
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:00,612
I'm just a ghost anyway.

581
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:03,182
- Aren't you hungry?
- What if I am?

582
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:06,543
I won't starve to death since I'm just a ghost.

583
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:21,083
My goodness, this samgyeopsal has such a nice colour.

584
00:40:23,113 --> 00:40:26,542
Maybe I should make bulgogi with this meat.

585
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,543
That sounds...

586
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:34,513
Gosh.

587
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,043
Gosh, I'm full.

588
00:41:26,343 --> 00:41:28,443
I think I'll do the dishes tomorrow.

589
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,652
(Star Animal Clinic)

590
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:58,112
I knew it.

591
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:00,413
Look at this.

592
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:03,242
The revenue is much lower than the old hospital's.

593
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:06,112
Didn't he use to have a clinic in Gangnam District?

594
00:42:06,113 --> 00:42:07,742
Yes, he did.

595
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,582
We used to be so busy.

596
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,942
Now, it's nothing compared to then.

597
00:42:10,943 --> 00:42:12,882
I wonder why he moved his clinic here.

598
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:14,712
This area is not a good place to open an animal clinic.

599
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:16,012
I know.

600
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:18,912
For some reason, he decided to move here.

601
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:21,312
Before, he used to decline professor positions as well.

602
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:25,913
Anyhow, I'm just happy I can work with him.

603
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:29,013
Finish up.

604
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,152
Thank you for today.

605
00:42:31,153 --> 00:42:33,482
Doctor. Are you going out?

606
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:35,782
Yes. I have to stop by somewhere.

607
00:42:35,783 --> 00:42:36,982
You can go home now.

608
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:39,682
- Okay. Thank you for today.
- See you tomorrow.

609
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,713
See you.

610
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:09,282
Hello?

611
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:10,912
Right now?

612
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:13,113
That was delicious.

613
00:43:13,613 --> 00:43:15,713
I'm so full.

614
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:18,152
I'm going out.

615
00:43:18,153 --> 00:43:19,942
You're going out? Where?

616
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:22,613
- I'm meeting some classmates.
- Classmates?

617
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:25,012
Are those guys going to pay you?

618
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:27,013
Yes.

619
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:28,942
Can I tag along?

620
00:43:28,943 --> 00:43:30,943
If you want.

621
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:37,343
Should we quench our thirst first?

622
00:43:49,313 --> 00:43:50,582
Here.

623
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,912
Here you go.

624
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:55,212
Bong Pal. Drink up.

625
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:57,443
I don't need to drink.

626
00:43:58,243 --> 00:43:59,782
Instead of paying me now,

627
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,212
if I exorcise that ghost...

628
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:02,682
Out of the reward,

629
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:04,842
we'll pay you 1,500 dollars,

630
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:08,743
which will benefit both you and us.

631
00:44:10,983 --> 00:44:12,983
3,000 dollars.

632
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:17,652
Sit down first.

633
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:19,182
You come out.

634
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:22,413
- Why?
- Just a second.

635
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,213
Hey. What are you doing?

636
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:27,382
I just want a taste.

637
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:28,912
I've been wondering how it tastes.

638
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:31,113
Put it down.

639
00:44:32,443 --> 00:44:35,042
You're too young to drink.

640
00:44:35,043 --> 00:44:37,083
Fine.

641
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:40,143
Hey!

642
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,582
We're offered only 4,000 dollars. We can't pay him 3,000 dollars.

643
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,413
We have to pay for the camera and the facility repair, too.

644
00:44:49,643 --> 00:44:52,882
What are we going to tell the sauna owner, then?

645
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:55,043
Are you going to fight the ghost?

646
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:56,682
Do you want me to die?

647
00:44:56,683 --> 00:44:58,182
Do you want me to get ripped apart?

648
00:44:58,183 --> 00:45:01,013
That's what I'm talking about.

649
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:03,983
3,000 dollars?

650
00:45:04,543 --> 00:45:06,543
Hey.

651
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:21,243
So...

652
00:45:21,783 --> 00:45:24,613
3,000 dollars it is.

653
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:28,782
3,500 dollars it is.

654
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:31,782
- We're giving up so much.
- I know.

655
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:33,783
Deal.

656
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:36,083
What are you asking me to do, by the way?

657
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:40,113
The thing is...

658
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:48,011
(Sauna)

659
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:02,110
You said you'd come tomorrow.

660
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:03,870
(Temporarily closed)

661
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:07,510
We're here...

662
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:08,510
to inspect the site...

663
00:46:08,511 --> 00:46:11,370
before we do the job.

664
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:12,970
Then...

665
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,210
you must be the exorcist.

666
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:18,411
You look very young.

667
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:20,471
You must be a student.

668
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,740
He's not the exorcist.

669
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,770
He's just assisting us...

670
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:29,570
with paperwork.

671
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:30,810
That's right.

672
00:46:30,811 --> 00:46:35,271
He wanted to get some hands-on experience.

673
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,470
- Right, Bong Pal?
- Absolutely.

674
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:40,410
Give me a call when you're done. I'll be around here.

675
00:46:40,411 --> 00:46:42,370
- Thank you in advance.
- No problem.

676
00:46:42,371 --> 00:46:45,711
You can rest assured.

677
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:54,471
Should we get uniforms?

678
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:02,310
Then again, that shouldn't matter...

679
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:04,610
as long as we can get rid of that ghost.

680
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:06,611
You're right.

681
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:11,111
Here we are.

682
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:26,710
(Pine Tree Sauna)

683
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,110
Do you see anything?

684
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,241
No, I don't.

685
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:33,710
Where is she, anyway?

686
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,540
- I'm here.
- I'm here, too.

687
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,541
Never mind.

688
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,270
Did someone die here?

689
00:48:00,271 --> 00:48:02,010
Yes, a man in his 50s.

690
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:05,510
According to the owner, he was a regular here,

691
00:48:05,511 --> 00:48:08,571
but he wasn't really welcomed.

692
00:48:09,111 --> 00:48:13,110
You know, he would sometimes...

693
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:14,810
grope female customers.

694
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:19,111
What do you call them? A pervert, as they say.

695
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,211
What is this?

696
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:47,611
- Hey.
- Where are you going?

697
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:53,640
Are you okay?

698
00:48:53,641 --> 00:48:56,811
- Yes, we're okay.
- I'm scared.

699
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:02,771
Where is he going?

700
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:08,541
That jerk.

701
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,870
He's quite strong.

702
00:49:24,871 --> 00:49:26,941
Bong Pal.

703
00:49:26,971 --> 00:49:28,810
What is it?

704
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:30,871
What should I do?

705
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:35,911
Why are they going round and round?

706
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:57,341
His chest!

707
00:50:57,571 --> 00:51:00,071
Hit his chest!

708
00:51:15,211 --> 00:51:18,271
Why didn't you do that earlier?

709
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,470
Is it over?

710
00:51:28,471 --> 00:51:30,511
Good job.

711
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,970
Hello!

712
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:37,641
Can you hear me?

713
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:42,270
Cheer up, baby, cheer up, baby.

714
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:45,010
Cheer up a little more.

715
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:47,710
Bong Pal, look at this.

716
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:52,280
Cheer up, baby, cheer up a little more.

717
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:55,151
Bong Pal, look at this.

718
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:57,781
Shy, shy, shy.

719
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:01,480
Gosh.

720
00:52:01,481 --> 00:52:04,010
It's rare to see a drunk ghost.

721
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:05,310
My friend...

722
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:07,280
Hey, Hyun Ji.

723
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:09,210
You're drunk.

724
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:11,310
I'm not drunk.

725
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:14,010
Look. I'm completely fine.

726
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:16,210
Bong Pal,

727
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:19,051
why are you so ugly?

728
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:22,810
You're so ugly.

729
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:26,210
What do you mean you're not drunk? You can't even stand.

730
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:30,010
What? Who? Me?

731
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:34,211
No way. I can walk just fine.

732
00:52:34,781 --> 00:52:38,010
Watch me. Watch.

733
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:42,350
I'll go like this here.

734
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:44,351
Gosh.

735
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,650
I walk well, right?

736
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:50,310
I can teleport even better.

737
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:52,651
Watch.

738
00:52:57,811 --> 00:52:59,810
That hurts.

739
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:01,811
I knew that would happen.

740
00:53:02,011 --> 00:53:04,881
Bong Pal...

741
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:07,050
What are you doing? Get up.

742
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:10,451
Bong Pal, I hurt myself.

743
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:13,950
- Hurry and get up. Let's go home.
- I'm not going.

744
00:53:13,951 --> 00:53:16,351
I won't go.

745
00:53:18,511 --> 00:53:19,980
Fine. Stay here all night.

746
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:21,950
I will, you jerk.

747
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,710
I'm going to live here.

748
00:53:23,711 --> 00:53:26,311
I'll stay up all night.

749
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:29,610
Hey. You...

750
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:33,980
You really... You shouldn't be like that.

751
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:36,981
Come here. You need a beating.

752
00:53:41,481 --> 00:53:43,780
How did you dodge that?

753
00:53:43,781 --> 00:53:46,511
Stay still.

754
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:54,910
What's wrong with you? Stop that.

755
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:57,451
How can a ghost be drunk?

756
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:03,611
Why not? Can't a ghost drink?

757
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:07,211
Can't a ghost want to wear pretty clothes?

758
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:12,111
Why can't I act like a human?

759
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:21,350
"You're just a ghost."

760
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:23,481
Just a ghost...

761
00:54:31,451 --> 00:54:33,981
Don't say things like that.

762
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:40,211
Do you think I died because I wanted to?

763
00:54:42,981 --> 00:54:45,581
I don't even know why I died.

764
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:50,351
I don't even know how I died.

765
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:03,451
I don't like being a ghost either.

766
00:55:06,251 --> 00:55:08,751
I don't like it either.

767
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:15,411
It's... It's not like I wanted to become a ghost.

768
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:23,051
Even ghosts can get hurt, too.

769
00:55:23,381 --> 00:55:25,581
You're such a jerk.

770
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:48,511
I have no idea what I'm doing.

771
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:51,480
- Bong Pal!
- Hey.

772
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,481
Hey.

773
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:57,511
You're so cute.

774
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,710
Gosh. Why is a ghost so heavy?

775
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:05,880
What?

776
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:08,810
Hey, I'm not heavy.

777
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:10,410
I'm light.

778
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:12,380
I'm probably light.

779
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:15,510
I'm like a feather.

780
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:17,951
Let's go home!

781
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:33,451
Noh Hyun Joo.

782
00:56:36,681 --> 00:56:38,711
Who are you?

783
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:51,981
Professor.

784
00:56:52,051 --> 00:56:54,151
You're going home late.

785
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:57,811
What are you doing here?

786
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:03,111
I came because there's something I want to ask you.

787
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:06,051
What is it?

788
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,051
Where did you...

789
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:19,881
find this?

790
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:40,311
This neighbourhood is really quiet.

791
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,981
There's hardly any people around.

792
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:49,510
(Bring it on, Ghost)

793
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:51,010
I have a clever scheme to get...

794
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:52,250
Bong Pal to join our club.

795
00:58:52,251 --> 00:58:53,310
Sundae soup!

796
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,950
I have no idea what you're talking about.

797
00:58:54,951 --> 00:58:56,410
- Do you want to join me?
- I would love to.

798
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,750
Your face got red in front of her and you were smiling like a fool.

799
00:58:59,751 --> 00:59:02,180
I could hear loud footsteps as if someone was jumping.

800
00:59:02,181 --> 00:59:04,510
I finally went up because I couldn't take it any more.

801
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:06,210
- I'm fleeing.
- From who?

802
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:07,250
Bong Pal?

803
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:09,880
He's really famous in the field. They say he's talented.

804
00:59:09,881 --> 00:59:11,881
Bong Pal.

805
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,650
Where do your parents live?

806
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:15,310
Have you contacted your father lately?

807
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,451
Why do you ask?

808
00:59:17,911 --> 00:59:20,510
Where did he go to bring back dirt with him?

809
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:22,951
- Hyun Ji.
- Yes?
